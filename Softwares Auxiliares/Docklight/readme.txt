Program Description:
Docklight is a test, analysis and simulation tool for serial communication 
protocols (RS232, RS485/422 and others). It allows you to monitor the 
communication between two serial devices or to test the serial communication
of a single device. Docklight is easy to use and runs on almost any standard 
PC using Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8 or Windows 7 operating system.

Docklight Scripting provides an easy-to-use program language and a built-in 
editor to create and run automated test jobs. In addition to COM ports (RS232, ...), 
Docklight Scripting supports TCP, UDP, USB HID or Named Pipes.

Installation:
- Run DocklightSetup.exe (resp. DocklightScriptingSetup.exe)

Distribution:
- See the fuh_distribute_int.txt file

Version History:

Docklight / Docklight Scripting V2.4.11 (03/2023)
Fixes and Improvements:
- Fixed high CPU usage with COM ports. (A Windows 10/11 issue that appeared after release; 
  new version avoids repeated GetCommMask calls which seem to be the cause.)
- External Editor support for "Visual Studio Code". Improved presets include now extra 
  waiting time to allow the external editor to complete the "save" operation
- Fixed display bug in Project Settings when switching between baud rate setting "none" 
  and actual baud rates.
- Fixed display bug when using a Send Sequence with parameters: The documentation area is 
  now updated before the Send Sequence Parameter dialog appears and shows the corresponding
  sequence documentation.
- Added checksum types: CRC-XMODEM (corresponds to CRC:16,1021,0000,0000,NO,NO) and MOD65536. 
  Added XOR and CRC-XMODEM to the dropdown list with common checksums.

Docklight / Docklight Scripting V2.4.5 (04/2022)
Fixes and Improvements:
- New Expert Option: Devices -> "Disable I/O error detection / hotplug feature for COM."
  Hotplug / auto-recovery was added in Docklight V2.3, but could produce I/O error events
  with some specific drivers even in normal operation. V2.4 has improvements, plus you can always
  disable hotplug completely (back to V2.2 behavior).
- Improved COM port RX timing for devices using Microsoft's standard driver usbser.sys on 
  Windows 10 and higher.  
- Fixed bugs with Project and Sequence Documentation area: wrong sequence index. 
- Fixed bugs with Project and Sequence Documentation area: Tables or other 
  complex documentation parts could get lost after storing/reloading/browsing/editing the project. 
- Fixed bug after removing a USB COM device, then stop and re-start communication in Docklight.
- Fixed rare "Internal comm. processing error" that was possible in rare overload situations, 
  e.g. after a sleep/resume. 
- Improved checksum preview when Special Function Characters are used.
- Fixed rare send button display bug: remained pressed when "Channel Alias" option was active.
- Scripting: DL.OpenProject now correctly uses relative paths like "..\myproject\project1.ptp"
- Scripting: Added "bigEndian" optional argument for DL.CalcChecksum 
- Scripting: new DL.MsgBox2 method, as a companion to DL.InputBox2 
- Scripting: Improved multiple connections / "side channel" support. Side channel IDs > 4 now 
  correctly supported for COM ports and (multiple) Docklight Tap Pro / 485 connections. 
- Scripting: DL.GetEnvironment("DOCKLIGHT_VERSION") now appends " (Eval)" to the result, if no 
  license key is present.
- Scripting: UDP connections with SO_BROADCAST and SO_REUSEADDR flags set.  
  
Docklight / Docklight Scripting V2.3.26 (03/2020)
Fixes and Improvements:
- Fixed bug with handshake status indicator box (was not continously updated).

  <text>: The text to use/add. If empty string (""), hide the user output area again. 
          Default is vbCrLf = add line break
  <rtfFormat>: False (default) = text is plain text. True = <text> is a RTF document
  <append>: True (default) = add to the existing output. False = replace the existing output
  <readFromFile>: False (default) = <text> is the actual content. True = <text> is a file path that should be loaded

New features and functions:
- New Docklight edition "Scripting" with built-in script editor for automated testing.
  Available as an upgrade for Docklight standard users. 
Fixes & Improvements:
- Non-standard baud rates can be used: Type any integer number between 110 and 999999
  in the corresponding dialog box. If the chosen rate is actually applied, depends on 
  the serial UART you are using. Non-standard baud rates may not work correctly when 
  "Flow Control" options are used.
- New Mode "Flow Control: Hardware Handshaking - RTS/CTS (Single Byte Mode):
  A sequence is placed byte-by-byte into the transmit buffer and CTS is checked before 
  each new character.
- New mode "Flow Control: RTS high while sending". This is to support RS485
  converters and related applications where the transceiver requires the PCs RTS signal
  to enable/disable the transmission.
- Improved communication processing and timing accuracy, which makes the "TweakComm" 
  utility provided to some users obsolete.
- ASCII Communication Window: Uniform behavior for different end-of-line standards:
  CR only, CR+LF, LF+CR
